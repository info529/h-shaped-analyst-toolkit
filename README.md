# h-shaped-analyst-toolkit
Bayesian forecasting toolkit for intelligence analysis. Captures expert priors, updates predictions with uncertainty quantification, and maintains full audit trails. Built on the H-Shaped Human Skills Model: AI that enhances analyst capability without creating dependency.

A production-ready forecasting system designed for defense intelligence applications. 
Implements Bayesian prior elicitation, evidence-based probability updates, and rigorous 
uncertainty quantification inspired by Jefferson Lab/DOE methodology. Supports multiple 
analytical domains (info ops, adversary modernization, geopolitical forecasting) through 
a shared infrastructure model. Aligns with the H-Shaped Human Skills Model for AI-enabled 
analysis—tools that sharpen judgment, not replace it.
